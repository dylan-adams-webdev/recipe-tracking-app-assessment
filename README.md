# Recipe Tracking App

This project is designed to provide an easy way for users to input and track recipes, including a photo.

### Context
This project was created as a real-world project using newly-acquired skills that enable user input inside a web application.

### Technologies
This project uses React (```create-react-app```) and vanilla css. The recipe gride is comprised of an html table with headers, and the inputs on the bottom of the page are another table. This is an effective and simple solution for displaying a list of structured data for the purposes of this project.

### Future Plans

This project will receive a style makeover and backend in the future to persist the user data. This project may receive an update that adds authentication as well.

### NOTE

I love connecting with other developers; there is always something to learn!

### Thank you

Thank you for dropping by!
